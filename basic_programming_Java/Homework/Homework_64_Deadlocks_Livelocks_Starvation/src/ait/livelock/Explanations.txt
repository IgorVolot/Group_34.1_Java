In this example, two threads (Worker-1 and Worker-2) are trying to do work, but they are dependent on each other.
They check if their colleague has finished work, and if so, they proceed with their own work. However,
if both threads are in a state of waiting for the other to finish work, they may end up in a livelock where they
keep checking and waiting without making any progress.

Livelocks are less common than deadlocks and can be trickier to identify and resolve. They often involve threads
being too cooperative with each other and getting stuck in a loop of trying to avoid conflicts.
